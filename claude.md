- When creating front end code, made sure that elements have a human readable identifier, so we can more easily debug and write browser tests
- When creating wizards, use side arrow navigation (not footer buttons). Place circular arrow buttons on the left and right sides of the wizard card using absolute positioning (`-translate-x-16` and `translate-x-16` to position outside the card). Back arrow on the left (hidden on first step), Next arrow on the right (blue, always visible). This keeps navigation in a fixed position without content jumping or scrollbars.
