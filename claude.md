- When creating front end code, made sure that elements have a human readable identifier, so we can more easily debug and write browser tests
- There may be multiple environments running simultaneously using different worktrees. To determine the corren environment, you can get port numbers and env name from the root .env file.
- When refactoring module names, run `grep -r "old_module_name" .` before committing to catch all remaining references (especially entry points like `main.py`). Use `__init__.py` re-exports for backward compatibility.
