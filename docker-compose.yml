# Ushaddow Docker Compose - Application Services
# This file contains only the application layer
#
# ⚠️ Prerequisites: Infrastructure must be running first!
#
# Recommended workflow:
#   ./go.sh              # First time (handles everything)
#.  ./quick-start.sh  # Setup infra + app and options
#   make up                       # Daily use (auto-starts infra if needed)
#
# Direct docker compose (manual):
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.infra.yml up -d  # Start infra first
#   docker compose up -d                              # Then start app
#   docker compose down                               # Stop app only
#
# Environment:
#   Uses .env.default (auto-generated by ./quick-start.sh)

name: ushadow

include:
  # Application services (backend API + web UI only)
  - compose/backend.yml
  - compose/frontend.yml

# Note: Memory services run in separate projects:
#   docker compose -f compose/memory.yml -p memory up -d
# This allows switching between different memory providers
