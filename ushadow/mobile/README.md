# Ushadow Mobile App

React Native mobile app for streaming audio to your Ushadow/Chronicle backend.

## Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Expo Go (Simplest - Limited Features)
**Best for:** Quick testing, no native BLE needed

```bash
cd ushadow/mobile
npm install
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code with Expo Go app. Note: BLE features won't work in Expo Go.

### Option 2: Development Build (Recommended for Development)
**Best for:** Full features, active development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build and run on connected device
npx expo run:ios      # For iOS (requires Mac + Xcode)
npx expo run:android  # For Android (requires Android Studio)
```

### Option 3: EAS Build (Easiest Distribution)
**Best for:** Sharing with others without app store

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Build for internal distribution
eas build --profile preview --platform android  # APK for sideloading
eas build --profile preview --platform ios      # Requires Apple Developer account
```

## Detailed Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js 18+** - [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. **Expo CLI** - `npm install -g expo-cli`
3. **For iOS:** Mac with Xcode 15+ and CocoaPods

```

#### Distribution via Internal Testing (Play Console)
1. Create a Google Play Console account ($25 one-time)
2. Upload to Internal Testing track
3. Add up to 100 testers by email
4. Testers install via Play Store link (not public)

### iOS Setup

npx expo run:ios --device
```

#### Distribution via TestFlight (Easiest for iOS)

   ```bash
   eas build --profile preview --platform ios
   ```
3. Submit to TestFlight via EAS or manually upload to App Store Connect

#### Distribution via Ad-Hoc (No TestFlight)
1. Collect device UDIDs from testers
2. Register devices in Apple Developer portal
3. Build with ad-hoc profile:

## Troubleshooting

### "Executable was signed with invalid entitlements" (iOS)
Your device needs to be registered. Use EAS device registration:
```bash
eas device:create
```

### BLE not working
- BLE requires a development build, not Expo Go
- Ensure Bluetooth permissions are granted
- On iOS, add bluetooth-peripheral background mode

### Connection failed
- Check your server is running and accessible
- Verify URLs don't have trailing slashes
- Try both `ws://` and `wss://` for stream URL

### Build fails
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:ios  # or android
```
